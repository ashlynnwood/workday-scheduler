## Description
This application was designed to allow users to create their own personalized work day schedule to stay on task. It lets users save events for each hour of the work day and displays each timeblock as a different color based on what time of day it is to show users their past, present, and future events.

To navigate this work day scheduler, you can click in the text area for any of the time blocks located in the middle of the page. This will allow you to input any tasks you need to complete during the workday. The user can input a task for each hour. The user can then click the blue save button on the right side of the page for each hour to save their tasks to the schedule. Past events will display gray, present events will display red, and future events will display green to help users prioritize their tasks. The current date will display in the header and will update everyday.
